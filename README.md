# Panel Method in MATLAB
An implementation of the panels method for aerodynamic calculations for MATLAB. The code is part of a university assignment (Universitat Politécnica de València), and can be further improved as the code is not optimized.

Two different panel methods are implemented, one for bodies that generate no lift,
using only sources and sinks, and another one where circulation is taken into account,
which can provide an approximation for the lift.
The panel method is implemented in a user friendly GUI which allows to obtain a wide
variety of results.

## Instructions on how to run the Panels method GUI
1. Open GUI_Panels_method type MATLAB Code file (Do not open the type MATAB Figure as it will not work correctly due 
to some variables that need to be defined with the Code file) *IMPORTANT!!!*

1. Once the MATLAB program has been correctly opened, click on the RUN button and the GUI object will open. You can now start using it.
